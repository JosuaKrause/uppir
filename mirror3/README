Requires: Python 2.5.X + simplejson or Python >= 2.6 and Python < 3.0.   

This code is pre-alpha!   Use at your own discretion / risk.   

One starts by creating a manifest of the files to release.   Then run a vendor
and set up a mirror.   Outside parties should run their own mirrors.   Then
clients can obtain content privately from the mirrors.

I'll put more detailed directions for how to use this under the main upPIR 
site.   This will initially be hosted at:
